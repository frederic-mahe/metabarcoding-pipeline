#+TITLE: Fred's metabarcoding pipeline

* introduction

A complete description of my current metabarcoding pipeline

(a replacement for [[https://github.com/frederic-mahe/swarm/wiki/Fred's-metabarcoding-pipeline][my old wiki]])

Code is presented in code-blocks that can be copy-pasted and executed
in a terminal.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  echo "fun with fastq files!"
  ls
  head
#+END_SRC

Results are presented in text blocks or tables:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  This is a raw result
#+END_SRC
